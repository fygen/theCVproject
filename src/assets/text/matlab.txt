In this lesson, which we have studied on `Matlab`, I have reduced the workload of the user by
making `Supervised Learning` into `Semi-Supervised Learning` by bringing a new order in the codes. I
used the sounds and the decomposition of the `artificial neural networks` we have created. In this way, in the new 
data entry of the sounds;
>The machine could classify the new data and tell which one it was, and if it was wrong, it
could save it as new audio data for calculating new SVM. 

And the program was able to create a better version by calculating
the best SVM (Support Vector Machine) again according to the number of neural networks to be
automatically selected after 10 new data entries. About this project contact my Optimisation Techniques teacher
