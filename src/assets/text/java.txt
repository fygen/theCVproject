When I was a Lieutenant, I needed to be in a field of software and wanted to have experience before the military ended. Searched online which is the best language for
android and I was directed to `JAVA`. There was no one around to teach me and the eclipse environment was a cave of errors, a soldier of mine told
me;
>Commander I see you working all the time and seeing that you work so hard, I can teach you Russian Language Tourism is easier and you have the social skills you can attract tourists, and that you are fluent in English, you could
easily catch Tourism oppurtunities.' 

After this conversation I was learning `Russian` language..
