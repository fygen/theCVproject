The project was about a computer which has its own OPERAND, OPCODE design, ALU unit, RAM and
ROM, which the RAM was coded by translated HEX code(Machine Code) from which I created the assembly
code from `C language`. The processor and all the parts are realized using a program called `LOGISIM` which
helps to create CLK and other Logic gates and simulating them in real time. Assembly code(ing)(Hex for
RAM) for the project which was about adding squared numbers in a sequence. Created a `Verilog` file for
unit 22f16c6 version of `FPGA DE0-NANO`.
