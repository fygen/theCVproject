Coding about `Python` is started with my interest of which language is the fastest and easiest to
automize create files and do things. I made subtitle converters for youtube which usable as .srt in file system.
Automized it with `Selenium` and `beautifulSoup` so I can pull data easily, made some automized image
converters for the automized website builder I build with `Html`,`Css`,Js...

Then I started from the beginning HTML, CSS, JS from the MozillaPage known as MDN, then FreeCodeCamp and got some certificates.
The moral of mine was a comment from the youtube about `JavaScript`(EcmaScript) because that
language is one of the most important language in websites also with `React`(&Native); compatible with nearly anything now.
